              Tatsuki Fujimoto was born in Nikaho, Akita Prefecture, in 1992 or
              1993. Without access to preparatory schools, he practiced oil
              painting in classes attended by his grandparents. He developed his
              artistic talents early and pursued formal education in art,
              graduating in Western painting from Tohoku University of Art and
              Design in 2014. His upbringing in a rural area influenced his
              creative journey, leading him to explore unconventional paths in
              his artistic development.

              Fujimoto's storytelling is deeply influenced by cinema,
              particularly Korean films like The Chaser and Japanese works such
              as Sadako vs. Kayako. He admired the unpredictable narratives of
              directors like Takeshi Kitano and was inspired by the tension and
              pacing of films like The Raid. His manga influences include
              Hiroaki Samura, Hideki Arai, and Tsutomu Nihei, whose distinctive
              styles shaped his approach to blending emotional depth with
              subversive, cinematic twists.
