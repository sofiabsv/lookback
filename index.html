                      Ayumu Fujino, an elementary school manga prodigy,
                      publishes her work in the school paper and gains
                      widespread acclaim. Her dominance is challenged by
                      Kyomoto, a reclusive yet highly talented illustrator whose
                      superior work pushes Fujino into a competitive obsession.
                      This fixation on surpassing Kyomoto alienates Fujino from
                      her loved ones and ultimately leads her to quit drawing
                      when she falls short. Tasked with delivering Kyomoto's
                      diploma after middle school graduation, Fujino meets
                      Kyomoto, who reveals herself as a devoted fan of Fujino's
                      work. Inspired by Kyomoto's admiration, Fujino rekindles
                      her passion for manga, and the two become collaborators.

                      for Shark Kick, while Kyomoto chooses to pursue formal art
                      education. Fujino thrives, with her manga even receiving
                      an anime adaptation. However, tragedy strikes when Kyomoto
                      becomes a victim in a mass murder at her art college.
                      Wracked with guilt, Fujino blames herself for encouraging
                      Kyomoto to pursue art, believing this indirectly led to
                      her death.

                      fragment of the comic seemingly time-travels to their
                      middle school days, altering events. Kyomoto, now too
                      startled by the comic to leave her room, still finds
                      motivation to pursue art on her own. In the altered
                      timeline, Fujino saves Kyomoto during the attack and
                      reconnects with her. Kyomoto expresses her admiration for
                      Fujino, and the two discuss creating manga together before

                      Realizing Kyomoto never stopped admiring her work, Fujino
                      wrestles with despair over her career. However, memories

        Inspiration Behind Look Back and the Art of Tatsuki Fujimoto

          <div class="col">
            <p>
              Tatsuki Fujimoto's Look Back is deeply inspired by his own
              struggles as an artist and his reflections following the 2011
              Tohoku Earthquake. During this time, Fujimoto grappled with
              feelings of powerlessness, questioning the purpose of art in the
              face of tragedy. These emotions fueled the story's central themes
              of resilience and finding meaning in creativity. Like Fujino in
              the story, Fujimoto realized that while art may not prevent
              tragedy, it can bring joy and connection to others, offering hope
              in difficult times. At its heart, Look Back is a celebration of
              art's power to communicate and inspire. Fujimoto's reflections on
              his own artistic journey, from despair to rediscovering the joy of
              creation, are mirrored in the story's narrative. The manga
              encourages readers to embrace the value of their work, showing
              that even in a world filled with tragedy, art has the power to
              uplift and connect people on a profound level.

                    Tatsuki Fujimoto was born in Nikaho, Akita Prefecture, in
                    1992 or 1993. Without access to preparatory schools, he
                    practiced oil painting in classes attended by his
                    grandparents. He developed his artistic talents early and
                    pursued formal education in art, graduating in Western
                    painting from Tohoku University of Art and Design in 2014.
                    His upbringing in a rural area influenced his creative
                    journey, leading him to explore unconventional paths in his
                    artistic development.

                    Fujimoto began his manga career with one-shot works such as
                    A Couple Clucking Chickens Were Still Kickin' in the
                    Schoolyard (2011) and Kami Hikōki (2013), earning awards and
                    recognition early on. He serialized his first major work,
                    Fire Punch (2016-2018), on Shōnen Jump+ before achieving
                    global acclaim with Chainsaw Man (2018-2020), which won
                    several prestigious awards, including multiple Harvey
                    Awards. Fujimoto continued to create acclaimed one-shots
                    like Look Back (2021) and Goodbye, Eri (2022), further
                    solidifying his reputation as an innovative storyteller.

                    Fujimoto's storytelling is deeply influenced by cinema,
                    particularly Korean films like The Chaser and Japanese works
                    such as Sadako vs. Kayako. He admired the unpredictable
                    narratives of directors like Takeshi Kitano and was inspired
                    by the tension and pacing of films like The Raid. His manga
                    influences include Hiroaki Samura, Hideki Arai, and Tsutomu
                    Nihei, whose distinctive styles shaped his approach to
                    blending emotional depth with subversive, cinematic twists.

              When his father died, Denji was stuck with a huge debt and no way

              Yuta Ito, a high schooler, receives a smartphone for his birthday
              and reluctantly uses it to fulfill his mother's request to
              document her final days. He later turns the footage into a school
              film, but its bizarre ending—featuring him fleeing a hospital
              explosion—leads to relentless bullying. Only Eri, a girl who
              admires his work, supports him. She convinces Yuta to collaborate
              on a new film, and as they grow closer, the boundaries between
              fiction and reality blur.
